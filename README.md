# Impact of Rent Control on Rental Housing Markets: A Case Study of Ontario and Québec

## Abstract
<div align='justify'>
Ontario’s history of rent controls began as a political campaign topic in 1975, and has remained an issue since, with even more demand for affordability in the 2020s. We evaluate the Fair Housing Plan of 2017 in Ontario, using Québec as a counterfactual. Our analysis uses a difference-in-differences approach to examine whether Ontario’s 2017 rent control measures influenced the proportion of rent-burdened households in the Ottawa–Gatineau region. Findings suggest that the policy did not significantly affect the evolution of rent burdens in Ontario. Despite the policy’s aim to limit rent increases, its average treatment effect on the treated was estimated to be null, indicating the policy’s limited effectiveness in addressing housing affordability challenges in Ontario.
